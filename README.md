## üéØ Problems Covered

- **Knapsack Problem** ‚Äì Select items with max value under a weight constraint.
- **Mathematical Function Optimization** ‚Äì Minimize different functions.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** ‚Äì Find the shortest tour through all cities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms Implemented

- Random Search
- Hill Climbing
- Tabu Search
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm (binary and real-valued)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Harmony Search (HS, IHS, EHS, EIHS)


## üìà Visualisations

For several algorithms, convergence plots and performance visualizations were included to better understand their behavior over time. These visualizations help illustrate:

- How quickly each algorithm approaches an optimal or near-optimal solution
- The effect of different parameter settings (e.g. mutation rate, temperature, population size)
- Performance comparisons between algorithm variants (e.g. GA vs PSO, HS vs EIHS)

Matplotlib was used for generating plots of fitness values across generations or iterations.

## üßæ Datasets

All datasets used are stored in the `data` directory and are organized as follows:

- `data/knapsack/`
  - `knapsack-20.txt` ‚Äì Small instance with 20 items
  - `rucsac-200.txt` ‚Äì Larger instance with 200 items

- `data/tsp/`
  - Contains all TSP instances used, such as `berlin52.tsp`, `kroE100.tsp`, `pr1002.tsp`, etc.
  - Formats follow the [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) standard


## üìä Features

- Tested on multiple problem instances and datasets
- Parameter tuning and comparisons
- Benchmark datasets
- Easy to run and adapt for new problems
